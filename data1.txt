1	Four
2	score
3	and
4	seven
5	years
6	ago
7	our
8	fathers
9	brought
10	forth
11	on
12	this
13	continent
14	a
15	new
16	nation,
17	conceived
18	in
19	liberty
20	and
21	dedicated
22	to
23	the
24	proposition
25	that
26	all
27	men
28	are
29	created
30	equal.
31	Now
32	we
33	are
34	engaged
35	in
36	a
37	great
38	civil
39	war,
40	testing
41	whether
42	that
43	nation
44	or
45	any
46	nation
47	so
48	conceived
49	and
50	so
51	dedicated
52	can
53	long
54	endure.
55	We
56	are
57	met
58	on
59	a
60	great
61	battlefield
62	of
63	that
64	war.
65	We
66	have
67	come
68	to
69	dedicate
70	a
71	portion
72	of
73	that
74	field
75	as
76	a
77	final
78	resting
79	place
80	for
81	those
82	who
83	here
84	gave
85	their
86	lives
87	that
88	that
89	nation
90	might
91	live.
92	It
93	is
94	altogether
95	fitting
96	and
97	proper
98	that
99	we
100	should
101	do
102	this.
103	But
104	in
105	a
106	larger
107	sense,
108	we
109	cannot
110	dedicate,
111	we
112	cannot
113	consecrate,
114	we
115	cannot
116	hallow
117	this
118	ground.
119	The
120	brave
121	men,
122	living
123	and
124	dead
125	who
126	struggled
127	here
128	have
129	consecrated
130	it
131	far
132	above
133	our
134	poor
135	power
136	to
137	add
138	or
139	detract.
140	The
141	world
142	will
143	little
144	note
145	nor
146	long
147	remember
148	what
149	we
150	say
151	here,
152	but
153	it
154	can
155	never
156	forget
157	what
158	they
159	did
160	here.
161	It
162	is
163	for
164	us
165	the
166	living
167	rather
168	to
169	be
170	dedicated
171	here
172	to
173	the
174	unfinished
175	work
176	which
177	they
178	who
179	fought
180	here
181	have
182	thus
183	far
184	so
185	nobly
186	advanced.
187	It
188	is
189	rather
190	for
191	us
192	to
193	be
194	here
195	dedicated
196	to
197	the
198	great
199	task
200	remaining
201	before
202	us...
203	that
204	from
205	these
206	honored
207	dead
208	we
209	take
210	increased
211	devotion
212	to
213	that
214	cause
215	for
216	which
217	they
218	gave
219	the
220	last
221	full
222	measure
223	of
224	devotion...
225	that
226	we
227	here
228	highly
229	resolve
230	that
231	these
232	dead
233	shall
234	not
235	have
236	died
237	in
238	vain,
239	that
240	this
241	nation
242	under
243	God
244	shall
245	have
246	a
247	new
248	birth
249	of
